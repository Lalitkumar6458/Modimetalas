      "Modi metals is a leading supplier and stockholder of compression pipe fittings, also known as ferrule fittings in stainless steel 304 and 316 grades. On demand we can also offer ferrule fittings in other grades such as brass, copper, nickel alloys and carbon steel. Double ferrule fittings are require no flaring of the metal tube to install. They are compressed onto the tubing to form strong leak proof connection in process, power and instrumentation applications. Ferrule fittings are ideal for a diverse range of industries, including process oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, military, pharmaceutical, and more. The single and double ferrule fittings are available in a broad range of sizes, materials, and configurations. Stainless steel ferrule fittings are widely used in hydraulic and pneumatic applications in a range of industries such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, natural gas, fertilizers and power generation.",
    text3: "Ferrule Fittings are pipe fittings that are used to connect two pipes of different material makes. Since welding or threading might not be sufficient to connect these pipes together, a pipe fitting with a ferrule or olive is used to connect them. There are different types such as standard, non – manipulative and flare fittings or manipulative fittings. Pearl Overseas produce all kinds of ferrule fittings for use with different material made pipes. The Brass Ferrule Fittings use brass as the ferrule. It is a connector that can adjust the differences between the two pipes being connected and brass is preferred where corrosive liquids are used. The Stainless Steel Ferrule Fittings are mostly used in hot water and cold water supply lines.",
